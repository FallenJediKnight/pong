# pong
Game #1 of my learning godot through the 20 games challenge
See https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/pong/

## Wishlist for if I ever come back to add more features

- Increase ball velocity slightly every time it hits a paddle
- Add basic sounds
- Add ability to reset the game with a button press
- Update resolution for better experience on mac screen
- Add ability to update some parameters in the UI:
	- Difficulty - maybe adding curve to paddles
	- ball velocity
- Move paddles back a bit so you can't knock the ball into your own goal area
